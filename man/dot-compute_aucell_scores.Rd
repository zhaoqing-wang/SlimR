\title{Compute AUCell-like rank-based scores}
\usage{
.compute_aucell_scores(expr_matrix, marker_sets, top_percent = 0.05)
}
\description{
Uses a ranking approach similar to AUCell: for each cell, genes are ranked by
expression, and the score is based on where marker genes fall in that ranking.
This method is robust to batch effects and technical variation.
}
\details{
Key improvement: Uses recovery curve area under curve (AUC) calculation
rather than simple proportion, giving partial credit to markers ranked
just outside the top threshold.
